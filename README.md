# KSC2Demo
A demonstration project for the Dual Channel Kulite Signal Conditioner (KSC-2) and a MATLAB API to control all of its features via USB. The KSC-2 is developed and produced by Kulite Semiconductor Products, Inc. based in Leonia, New Jersey.

## Build/Run Requirements
You will need MATLAB R2015b or later, especially if you are planning to compile the software into an executable with the MATLAB Application Compiler because earlier versions had a bug with recognizing the National Instruments NI 9218/9171 DAQ and chassis combo.
The setup is supposed to operate under specific connections (although these can change):

### Physical Setup
The microphone/pressure transducer is connected without a preamplifier to the first channel of the KSC-2 where it is only amplified (and applied a low-pass filter with 20kHz cutoff frequency by default to prevent aliasing). Then, the output of the first channel feeds into the input of the second channel where the proprietary resonance compensation (REZCOMP&copy;) is applied to the signal. The compensated signal is then fed to the second channel of the DAQ device. The DAQ is connected to the computer via USB. The KSC-2 also needs to be connected for this demo (so that its settings change while the experiment is run - namely the software reevaluates the correct value for the resonant frequency and the quality factor).

### Software
MATLAB R2015b or later and the Signal Analysis Toolbox are required to run the source code. The MATLAB Runtime is required for running the executable under /Multi-Window/for_testing/.
